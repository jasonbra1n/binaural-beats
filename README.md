What Are Binaural Beats?
Binaural beats occur when two slightly different frequencies are played separately into each ear (via headphones). The brain perceives the difference between these frequencies as a rhythmic beat. For example:

Left ear: 200 Hz
Right ear: 202 Hz
Perceived beat: 2 Hz (delta wave, ideal for deep sleep)
Heinrich Wilhelm Dove discovered this phenomenon, noting its potential to influence brainwave patterns:

Delta (1-4 Hz): Deep sleep
Theta (4-8 Hz): Light sleep, REM, relaxation
Alpha (8-12 Hz): Calmness, pre-sleep relaxation
Your query mentions "100 Hz to 60 Hz," which likely refers to the carrier frequencies (the base tones), with the binaural beat frequency being their difference. For deep sleep, we'll ensure the difference falls within the delta range (e.g., 2 Hz), using a carrier around 200 Hz for better perception, as higher carriers (up to 1000 Hz) are more effective, per research.

Features
Sleep Cycle Mode:
Starts with alpha (10 Hz) for relaxation.
Transitions to delta (2 Hz) after 30 minutes for deep sleep.
Rises back to alpha (10 Hz) 30 minutes before the end for gentle waking.
User specifies total time (e.g., 8 hours).
Tone Generator Mode:
Selectable states: Delta (2 Hz), Theta (6 Hz), Alpha (10 Hz), Beta (20 Hz), Gamma (40 Hz).
Custom frequency option for flexibility.
Includes REM state (theta) and a "healing frequency" option (using 432 Hz as the carrier).
